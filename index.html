				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I am born and raised in Melbourne, Australian and speak English. I graduated at Camberwell High School in 2017 and am currently studying a Bachelor of Fine Arts at RMIT. I live with an orange tabby cat named Arthur, and enjoy very much the game of Chess. Additionally, I’m an avid cinema-goer and I love to play the guitar. </p>


			<p>An interest in IT has been bubbling subconsciously throughout the technologically absorbed generation I grew up with, manifesting in playing computer games (AoE, HoMM, DotA, CS, TF2), listening to music through my headphones on my iPod, taking photos and watching dvds. I have always liked sitting at a computer, operating it and customising it with a mechanical keyboard and the most accurate optical laser mouse that’s current on the market.  </p>
			<p>As a child I helped my parents and grandparents with setting up their televisions, phones, computers, ect. And thus technology became a language, and it felt natural – that I could understand it. IT as a career and a set of skills only occurred recently as I’ve had to confront the reality of feeding Arthur and myself, as well as the pursuit to realise ideas and concepts. I’ve looked back at the aforementioned, at how I’ve enjoyed IT throughout my life and how it can contribute to the world.</p>
            <p>I chose RMIT because of its location, its reputation, and that I was accepted in, as well as its tech/practical focus – you can’t spell the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology without Technology. Through my school tour at RMIT I got the sense of a cutting-edge technological modern approach to university which appealed to me.  <p>
            <p>I expect to gain confidence, work ethic, friends, and a level of virtuoso during my studies at RMIT. I wish to leave with an insight into the industry, knowledge of the relevant historical, cultural and social context of my area of study and the practical sensibility to make action the skills I learn. If I was in a movie in a group of survivors on a deserted island, I wish to be the guy that possesses those skills and knowledge. Furthermore, in a sequel to that film, by the time it was filmed, I’d have turned those skills into a career and an occupation and be characterised amongst the group of survivors by that. This is my idealistic approach, and I’m sceptical of it - wary that the current state of careers is ever-changing and that pathways are mazed and even yet to be paved. However, to navigate this, at RMIT I wish to build a solid foundation and the resilience to embark on what the future has in store, so I can have agency over my destiny.

When forming a team, being in a support role would seem ideal in that the contributions would aid in being group centered. <p>

				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Gallery Exhibitor</p>
			<p>
Overview -

Website that enables the virtualisation of an exhibition on a computer web browser. Allows the user to input a series of artworks to generate a 3D navigable world modelled off a gallery that they can share online and have people browse and comment on their exhibit full of artworks. <p>
			<p>Motivation -

With how liveable the internet can be, and its mass convenience, it poses an opportunity for a highly spreadable and easy delivery of artworks. Cohesive delivery of an exhibition that an in person gallery achieves is made difficult with the current dominant visual platforms, mainly social media. ‘Gallery exhibitor’ allows a user-based customisable art work showcasing tool that can collectively and cohesively present an exhibition. It also has potential to change the way we encounter the artworks which may prove to be interesting. <p>
<p>Description -

The website allows a user to upload a set of images or videos to the software, edit their sizes then be able to generate a plain white walled 3D space that contains the media. This generated world gets a link that is sharable, allowing people to tune in and explore the exhibit. A given user can then navigate the 3D space like a video game and view the artworks. The exhibition is timed and only available for a set amount of time (eg. One week), but unlimited user access is permitted in this time frame. Corresponding to this, an anonymous chat log is on the sidebar allowing users to comment. The chat log messages are additive and kept up for the duration of the exhibition. The website opens and presents a menu in which the user can upload their works, and then once the ‘world’ is generated, a link is procured and made sharable. The ‘player’ navigates the map with typical WASD or arrow keys with camera movement using the mouse allowing them to freely browse the exhibited artworks. Hovering the mouse over a given work presents a Name, Year, Medium (description). You can adjust global lighting, artwork focused lighting and add spatial sound.<p>
<p>Tools and Technologies -

The website is to be web game engine based. Using a WebGL Game Engine like PlayCanvas, a computer is necessary to program the menu and map. <p>
<p>Skills Required -

Basic usability of a WebGL Game Engine is required. A command of desktop usage and general basic computer skills is necessary. The project should be feasible given the quality of existing WebGL Game Engines, which provide GUI’s for ease of use, limiting the need for advanced coding. The clarity and simplicity of the idea should make its progress straightforward with hurdles along the way ready to be tackled. <p>
<p>Outcome - Upon successful implementation, artists would have an open tool platform to process their art works in such a way as to display them with coherence and unity – giving their creations the presentation and order logic the artist intended in accordance with the tradition of the physical art gallery – a blank open and even space. The convenience and internet based delivery means they can make highly accessible and transmissible their exhibit, allowing people all over the world and wherever they are to view. The engagement via the web also alters the way in which the artworks are interpreted and makes a critique of the internets presence in the very traditional and possibly archaic art world. Gallery Exhibitor indicates an expanded and future take on the way exhibitions are engaged with.
